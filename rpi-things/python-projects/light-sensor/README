If This Then That (IFTTT)
IFTTT is a web service that allows you to set up
triggers that then cause an action.

The way this works is that the Raspberry Pi sends
a web request to IFTTT as a trigger and then IFTTT
performs whatever action you have specified for it.
In this case, that is sending a notification and playing a song on my Android Phone.
(I have to have the IFTTT app on the phone as well)

Use the Maker Channel
The Maker Channel allows you to connect IFTTT to your personal DIY projects.
With Maker, you can connect a Recipe to any device or service that can make or
receive a web request (aka webhooks).
