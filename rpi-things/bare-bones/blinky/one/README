UART + GPIO driver
------------------

GPIO function selector is used to define the operation of the general-purpose I/O pins.
GPFSEL[0-5] maps all 54 GPIOs.

Each Register handles 10 GPIOs and are split as follows

Example:
GPFSEL0

Bit  -> 31-30 29-27 26-24 23-21 20-18 17-15 14-12 11-9 8-6 5-3 2-0
GPIO -> RSVD    9     8     7     6     5     4     3   2   1   0


A note on compiler optimization
-------------------------------

	Consider a loop like the one below
	
	while (1) {
		GPIO_SET(47);
		GPIO_CLR(35);
		delay(0x1000);
		GPIO_SET(35);
		GPIO_CLR(47);
		delay(0x1000);
	}

	Such a loop is never infinte, the while (1) is removed and your LEDs blink only once.
	We have to have calls to functions that are not inline. Only then it will be honoured
	as an infinite loop.

	So, a loop like this won't get optimized

	while (1) {
		blink(47);
		blink(35);
	}

	Or, even a loop like the one described by dwelch67.
